# Web components

Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps whatever it's the Javascript framework, library or Vanilla JS you use for your apps.

But, is it possible to use Web Components in React or React to create Web components?

According to [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/web-components.html): "React and Web Components are built to solve different problems... As a developer, you are free to use React in your Web Components, or to use Web Components in React or both"

We could start to play with some simple examples to know limitations about that.
